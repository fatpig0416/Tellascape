# Tellascape

App to facilitate to build your journey and share your photo/videos with followers

## Requirements

- we use [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `lts/carbon`.

      	if you have [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) installed it should pick up the version from the `.nvmrc`
        file and do the rest for you.

- we use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

---

## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

This is a [React Native app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for iOS and Android.

---

## ðŸ“– Docs

- [Wiki Page]()

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://tellascape_pardeep@bitbucket.org/tellascapedevelopers/tellascape.git

# Install node dependencies
yarn
```

#### 2. Run the _React Native_ App

```bash
# Start the React Native packager
yarn start

```

Instructions are shown in the terminal. You can select to open it in:

- An emulator (either iOS or Android)

for Ios you can either run

```bash
# for production
react-native run-ios
# or for debugging
react-native run-ios
```

---

## Versioning

We follow the principles of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and the abilities of [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/version) to bump version numbers during the development.

Android is configured to fetch the version number from the `package.json` during the gradle build process. For Ios there is a file `scripts/version-ios.sh` which will be automatically invoked whenever `yarn version` is triggered. its purpose is to customize the version data within the `ios/tellascape/Info.plist`.

so basically whenever a sprint is closed or a release is planed just run

    yarn version

---

---

## ðŸ–¼ Assets

we have script in `scripts/build-assets.js` for exporting, converting and installing the appicons, launchscript and vectoricons from the `assets/stylesheet.sketch` file.

    yarn assets

## ðŸ‘Š Get in Touch
